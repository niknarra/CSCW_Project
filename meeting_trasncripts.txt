[00:00:05] Premih: Hey guys, thanks for joining. Let's start planning our trip to India!

[00:00:10] Nikhil: Absolutely! Been looking forward to this for a while.

[00:00:15] Stanley: Me too. Let's make this trip unforgettable!

[00:00:20] Premih: First things first, let's list out the places we want to visit. Any suggestions?

[00:00:30] Nikhil: I've always wanted to see the Taj Mahal in Agra and Jaipur's forts.

[00:00:35] Stanley: Let's not miss Kerala's backwaters. I've heard they're serene.

[00:00:40] Premih: Great choices. We should also visit Goa's beaches and maybe a trek in Himachal Pradesh.

[00:00:50] Nikhil: That sounds like a lot. How long are we planning to stay?

[00:00:55] Stanley: Around 15 days? We can split our days across these locations.

[00:01:00] Premih: Sounds good. Let's discuss the travel requirements next. Any ideas on what we need?

[00:01:10] Nikhil: We need visas, of course. And we should check if there are any travel advisories.

[00:01:15] Stanley: Don't forget vaccinations. We should also get travel insurance.

[00:01:20] Premih: Good points. I'll create an action item for each of us to research on these.

[00:01:30] Nikhil: Also, we should set reminders for booking flights, accommodations, and local transport.

[00:01:35] Stanley: Speaking of local transport, should we rent a car or rely on public transport?

[00:01:40] Premih: Public transport is reliable in most places, but renting a car gives us flexibility. Let's think about it.

[00:01:50] Nikhil: Any cultural or safety alerts we should be aware of?

[00:01:55] Stanley: Dress modestly in religious places. And avoid drinking tap water.

[00:02:00] Premih: We should also be wary of scams and always negotiate prices before buying or using services.

[00:02:10] Nikhil: I'll create a shared document where we can list down all these alerts and reminders.

[00:02:15] Stanley: Great idea. Let's also list down the local cuisines we want to try.

[00:02:20] Premih: Biryanis, kebabs, dosas... the list is endless!

[00:02:30] Nikhil: I've heard about this Rajasthani thali. We should definitely try that in Jaipur.

[00:02:35] Stanley: And Goan seafood!

[00:02:40] Premih: Alright, let's wrap up. We have our action items and reminders. Let's reconvene in a week?

[00:02:45] Nikhil: Sounds good. I'll share the document with both of you.

[00:02:50] Stanley: Perfect. Can't wait for this trip!

[00:02:55] Premih: Me neither. Talk to you guys soon!

[00:03:00] Meeting Ended.

[00:03:05] Nikhil: Before we end, I forgot to mention one thing. What about currency? Should we exchange beforehand or withdraw there?

[00:03:15] Stanley: It's always good to have some local currency on hand. But ATMs are widely available in cities.

[00:03:20] Premih: I'd recommend exchanging a small amount before we land and then using ATMs or card payments. Just inform your bank about the travel.

[00:03:30] Nikhil: Makes sense. Also, should we get local SIM cards for our phones?

[00:03:35] Stanley: Yes, it will be much cheaper than international roaming. We can get them at the airport.

[00:03:40] Premih: Good point. I've read about some popular telecom operators there. I'll share the details with you guys.

[00:03:50] Nikhil: Great! Also, what about accommodations? Should we book in advance or find places on arrival?

[00:03:55] Stanley: Given that we're traveling to popular destinations, it's better to book in advance.

[00:04:00] Premih: Agreed. Plus, early bookings might get us some discounts. Let's allocate cities to each person and start looking for accommodations.

[00:04:10] Nikhil: I'll take care of Agra and Jaipur.

[00:04:15] Stanley: I'll handle Kerala and Goa.

[00:04:20] Premih: Perfect, I'll manage Himachal Pradesh. Also, let's consider using local experiences like homestays. It'll give us a real feel of the place.

[00:04:30] Nikhil: That's a brilliant idea. I've heard homestays in Kerala offer authentic local meals. 

[00:04:35] Stanley: Speaking of meals, any dietary restrictions we need to communicate?

[00:04:40] Premih: I'm allergic to shellfish, so I'll have to be careful in Goa.

[00:04:50] Nikhil: Noted. I'll make sure to include that in our shared document.

[00:04:55] Stanley: Anything else we're missing?

[00:05:00] Premih: Just one last thing. We should carry essential medications and a basic first-aid kit. You never know.

[00:05:10] Nikhil: Good call. I'll add that to our checklist.

[00:05:15] Stanley: I think we've covered most things for now. Let's keep updating the document and finalize plans in our next meeting.

[00:05:20] Premih: Sounds like a plan. Excited for this trip, guys!

[00:05:25] Nikhil: Me too! Stay safe and keep in touch.

[00:05:30] Stanley: Will do. Take care, and see you both next week.
